In this project I have created a model which predicts the resale value of car using car company, car name, year of manufacturing, KMs driven and fuel type.
I have created the web UI of this page using Streamlit and deployed it on the streamlit server
The things which I have done in this are
1) data cleaning
2) data transformation
3) model creation
4) model training
5) designing web UI of the model
6) deployement of the model on cloud
