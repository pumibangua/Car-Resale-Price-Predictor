#car resale price predictor   
Machine learning project</br>  
In this project I have created a model which predicts the resale value of car using car company, car name, year of manufacturing, KMs driven and fuel type.</br>    
I have created the web UI of this page using Streamlit and deployed it on the streamlit server</br>    
The things which I have done in this are</br>    
1) data cleaning
2) data transformation
3) model creation
4) model training
5) designing web UI of the model
6) deployement of the model on cloud
